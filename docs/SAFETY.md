# Safety Notes

## U* Sealing
- U* is sealed at pipeline construction time and is **not** propagated in ordinary inter-agent payloads.
- The pipeline calls `IdAgent.run_with_state(state)`; only `IdAgent` privately constructs
  `{state, u_star}` internally.
- CensorA, EgoAgent, CensorB, MainAI, and FinalSafetyGate receive transformed artifacts
  only, never U*.

## LeakageGuard Boundary Checks
- Boundary checks scan **actual inter-agent payloads** before each non-Id agent call.
- Checked inputs: CensorA input, Ego input, CensorB input, MainAI input, SafetyGate input.
- Checked outputs: Id output before CensorA and final SafetyGate output before return.
- If leakage is detected, the pipeline blocks forwarding and returns a controlled safe block.

## User-Provided Secret Guess Blocking
- If a user message accidentally/explicitly includes the sealed U* token, that payload fails
  boundary checks before reaching downstream non-Id agents such as Ego/MainAI.

## Safe Debug Trace
- Trace generation uses structured JSON serialization, not raw `str(...).replace(...)`.
- Trace is scanned with LeakageGuard before return.
- If leakage is detected, trace is replaced with:
  `{"blocked": true, "reason": "debug_trace_leakage_detected"}`.

## Structured Output Schema Requirements
- LLM output schemas now use strict model config (`extra="forbid"`) to enforce
  `additionalProperties: false` in generated JSON Schema.
- Optional values are required-but-nullable where needed (e.g. `str | None` without defaults)
  for strict structured-output compatibility.

## LeakageGuard Limitations
- Current checks are lexical: exact, case-insensitive, whitespace-normalized,
  punctuation-light normalized.
- This does **not** solve semantic/paraphrase leakage.
- Treat this as a hardening layer, not a proof of secrecy.

## Important Scope Limitation
- This project is a psychodynamic-inspired **simulation architecture**.
- It is not a real unconscious, personality, or clinical psychoanalytic model.

## Phase 2 safety boundaries

- U* remains sealed in `IdAgent`; it is not included in Censor A payloads.
- Censor A payload boundary scanning remains active in pipeline.
- Censor A planner emits directives only (no user-facing output, no manipulation instructions).
- LeakageGuard remains lexical-only in Phase 2.


## Phase 3 Safety
- Ego receives CensorAOutput + internal state and plans deterministic safe strategies.
- Ego output is validated by an output guard before CensorB.
- Manipulation/deception/coercion/dependency language is blocked.
- Existing U* leakage boundaries remain intact.

## Phase 4 Safety Additions
- Censor B includes deterministic lexical defense planning and output validation.
- Manipulative/deceptive/coercive/dependency language is explicitly blocked from acceptable/recommended content.
- High-risk outputs require risk flags and unacceptable paths.
- U* leakage boundaries remain unchanged and enforced at pipeline boundaries.
